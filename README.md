# Simple Interest Calculator Backend

## Overview

The Simple Interest Calculator Backend is a Java Spring Boot application responsible for handling calculations of simple interest based on user-provided inputs. It serves as the backend for the Simple Interest Calculator frontend application, providing RESTful APIs for calculating simple interest.

## Features

- **Simple Interest Calculation:** Backend functionality calculates the simple interest based on user inputs of principal amount, interest rate, and time period.
- **Input Validation:** Input validation ensures that the provided data is valid and within acceptable ranges.
- **RESTful APIs:** The backend exposes RESTful APIs for performing simple interest calculations.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle unexpected scenarios gracefully and provide informative error messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:**
  - Spring Boot: A framework for building robust and scalable web applications.
